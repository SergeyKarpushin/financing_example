## What you get

The application in this repository: 
* creates an H2 database in the root directory of the project;
* sets up the database structure according to the entities;
* seeds some initial data, runs the financing algorithm and prints out the report.

## What you need to do

You need to implement the financing algorithm according to the specification. The algorithm has to
calculate the results of the financing and persist them. One invocation of the algorithm represents
one financing round. The invoices financed in a financing round are considered to be "financed" and 
may not be financed in the subsequent financing rounds. 

To store the results of the financing, you will have to adjust the data structure. You are free to create 
new entities and adjust the existing ones.

Your entry points are `FinancingService` and `ReportingService` classes. Naturally, you may create additional
classes, if needed. You can also add new relations, new entities or fields to existing ones. You may also 
use any third-party dependencies you need. 

If you don't like something in the provided code, you are free to change it. You're also free to adjust the
seeding data if you wish to make it more representative.

## Financing algorithm specification

The terminology used here is described in more detail in the Glossary section.

The financing algorithm should be applied separately to each invoice in the database which was not financed 
in the previous rounds.

For each non-financed `Invoice`:
* select the single financing `Purchaser`;
* calculate the `Purchaser`'s interest and the `Creditor`'s payment for this invoice;
* persist the financing data.

A `Purchaser` is eligible for financing of the `Invoice`, if:
* the `Purchaser` has set up the settings for the invoice's `Creditor` (has a `PurchaserFinancingSettings` 
  defined for this `Creditor`);
* the financing term of the invoice (duration between the current date and the maturity date of the invoice) 
  is greater or equal to the value `Purchaser.minimumFinancingTermInDays` for this `Purchaser`;
* the `Purchaser`'s financing rate for the invoice doesn't exceed the `Creditor.maxFinancingRateInBps` value 
  for the invoice's `Creditor`. 

Of all purchasers eligible for financing, select the one with the lowest financing rate. This will be the 
`Purchaser` that finances the invoice.

### Reporting specification

Reporting should contain a record for each unique Purchaser/Creditor pair that participated in the latest
financing: if the Purchaser financed any invoices of this Creditor in this financing round, there should
be one record for this Purchaser/Creditor. If the Purchaser didn't finance any invoices of this Creditor,
there should be no records for this Purchaser/Creditor.

### Example

The rates are measured in bps (basis points). One basis point is 0,01%, or 0,0001.

Suppose today is 2021-05-27. We have 2 purchasers Purchaser1 and Purchaser2 and one creditor Creditor1.
Purchaser1 has set up the annual rate of 50 bps for the Creditor1. Purchaser2 has set up 40 bps for the same creditor.
The Creditor1 has set up 4 bps as maximum financing rate.

The Creditor1 has a single invoice with the value of 10 000,00 EUR and the maturity date of 2021-06-26. 
The financing term of the invoice (duration between today and maturity date) is then 30 days. 

When we run the financing, the financing rate for Purchaser1 for this invoice should be calculated as 
50 bps * 30 days / 360 days/year = 4,167 bps, the financing rate for Purchaser2 would be 
40 bps * 30 days / 360 days/year = 3,333 bps. The Purchaser1's financing rate is greater than the maximum financing
rate set up by the Creditor, so only Purchaser2 wins the financing of the invoice.

The Purchaser2's interest is then calculated as 10 000,00 EUR * 3,333 bps * 0,0001 = 3,33 EUR. 
The creditor payment is 10 000,00 EUR - 3,33 EUR = 9 996,67 EUR.

The reporting should then produce something like:

```
Purchaser2  Creditor1   9 996,67 EUR    3,33 EUR
```

## What we'd like to see

* implementation of the financing algorithm;
* persisting of the financing results;  
* implementation of the reporting;
* tests verifying that your solution is correct;
* any documentation you think is necessary for your solution.

## If this was too easy

* when calculating the term of the financing, consider only working days;
* implement Debtor blacklisting: if a Purchaser has added a Debtor to a blacklist,
  then this Purchaser is not eligible for financing of this Debtor's invoices.

## Glossary

* **Creditor** - a company that has sold some goods to the **Debtor**
* **Debtor** - a company that has purchased some goods from the **Creditor**
* **Invoice** - according to this document, the **Debtor** is to pay to the **Creditor** for the purchased goods 
  on a specific date in the future called **maturity date**.  
* **Maturity date** - the date when the **Creditor** expects the payment from the **Debtor**. If the **Invoice**
is financed, and the **Creditor** already got their money early from the **Purchaser**, this is the date when
  the **Debtor** pays to the **Purchaser** instead.
* **Purchaser** - a bank that is willing to finance the **Invoice** (i.e. provide money for this invoice early 
  to the **Creditor**), with some **interest** subtracted. The **Purchaser** receives the full amount of money 
  from the **Debtor** on **maturity date**, thus receiving their **interest**.  
* **Financing date** - the date on which the financing has occurred.  
* **Financing Term** - the duration in days between the **financing date** and the **Invoice**'s
  **maturity date**. The financing is essentially a loan given by the **Purchaser** to the **Creditor** for the 
  duration of the term, with a certain **financing rate** and responsibility of the **Debtor** to pay back the loan.
* **bps** - basis points, a unit of measure for the rates. 1 bps = 0.01% = 0.0001.
* **Annual Rate** - the interest (in bps) that the **Purchaser** expects to get for the term of 360 days.
* **Financing Rate** - the actual financing rate for a particular **Invoice**, proportional to its financing term. 
  Calculated as `financingRate = annualRate * financingTerm / 360`
* **Early payment amount** - the amount of money paid by the **Purchaser** to the **Creditor** for the particular
financed invoice on **financing date**. This amount is less than the value of the invoice.
* **Maturity payment amount** - the amount of money paid back by the **Debtor** to the **Purchaser** on 
  **maturity date**. This amount is equal to the value of the invoice.
* **Purchaser interest** - the difference between **maturity payment amount** and **early payment amount**.
